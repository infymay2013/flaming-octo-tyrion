Objective: 
To develop pseudo code writing skills for a given problem using certain logic.


Case study: An institution offers several programs. Each program has several courses. There
are students who have opted for these courses. There are Educators who offer these courses.


Problem 1: At a given point of time we need to allocate a course to an educator for a given
period. Before allocating a course to an educator the following conditions are to be checked.
1. Enough number of students have registered for the course
AND
2. The course is added into the educator’s skill set
AND
3. Educator’s calendar is free for the given period
AND
4. Educator is not on leave for the given period
And
5. Educator has not yet completed his delivery targets Or There is no other alternative


1)input no_of_students, educators_skill_set, educators_free_calendar, educators_leave_list
			,pending_works_for_educators
2)if(no_of_students are reg for the course)
3)	if(educators_skill_set contains the course name)
4)		if(educators_free_calendar not conflicting with course date)
5)			if(educators_leave_list doesn't fall on course date range)
6)				if(no pending_works_for_educators)
7)					/* THEN DO SOMETHING HERE*/
8)end-if
