Problem 4: Write a pseudo code to take the starting value, common difference and the
number of terms of an arithmetic progression in variables a, d and n respectively and display
its nth term and sum of n terms


Solution:
1)input start_value, cd, no_of_terms
2)a = start_value , d = cd , n = no_of_terms
3)nth_term = a+((n-1)*d)
4)sum_of_n_terms = (n/2)*((2*a)+((n-1)*d))
