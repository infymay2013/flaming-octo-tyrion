Problem 1: Write a pseudo code to take two numbers as input in variables a and b and display
i.Product of the two numbers a and b
ii.Sum of the two numbers a and b
iii.Values of a-b and b-a
iv.Quotient and remainder for a/b and b/a




Solution i:
1)input a , b
2)product = a * b
3)display product

Solution ii:
1)input a,b
2)sum = a + b
3)display sum

solution iii:
1)input a , b
2)diff = a - b
3)display diff
5)diff2 = b - a
6)display diff2

solution iv:
1)input a,b
2)q1 = a/b
3)r1 = a%b
4)display q1,r1
5)q2 = b/a
6)r2 = b%a
7)display q2,r2
